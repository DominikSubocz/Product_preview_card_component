## My process
So I basically start by adjusting, tweaking and editing the HTML document to my liking,this is where I add divs and wrap plain text with various html tags, until everything is basically wrapped up nicely, and it looks neat.

My process of making websites from that point is usually a little bit messy, and by that I mean that I sometimes tend to write code possibly overcomplicated than it should be, leave duplicate code in different breakpoints, but HEY! it matters that it works and looks almost identical.

Anyways, then I move onto writing the CSS file. This time I used SCSS(SAAS), I wanted to experiment with new stuff, while I have not used it to its full potential with this website, I plan to explore its features in my future projects. Not so long ago, I would start styling my website from Desktop to Mobile, now I do it the opposite way like I should've in the past, cause it's much easier. Throughout thie part, I just style elements bit by bit, add breakpoints one by one, and when I'm nearly reaching the end, then it's just adjusting and tweaking things.

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React]([https://reactjs.org/](https://sass-lang.com/)) - SCSS (SAAS) 

### What I learned

Not gonna lie, but I just started with SCSS, I haven't learned much, but for now I learned about custom variables, which I have used to name my colours

```scss
    $this-is-a-test:hsl(H, S, L);

.proud-of-this-css {
  color: $this-is-a-test;
}
```
Apart from that I have learned some cool trick with flex layout, that I just discovered in the previous project I think.
Anyways here's how it works I think:


So what this essentially does, is that it acts as flex, but it keeps elements in one line I think, I had to add two aligns so it's perfectly inline with my shopping icon.
